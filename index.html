                    <p>AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. This includes learning, reasoning, and self-correction. It is based on mathematics, statistics, and computer science.</p>
                    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that focuses on creating systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as learning, thinking, and perception.</p>

                    <h3 class="title">History of AI</h3>
                    <p>Pre-1950: Ideas of AI have philosophical roots in the writings of thinkers such as Aristotle, who conceptualized deductive logic, and Alan Turing, who developed the theory of computation.</p>
                    <p>1950s: John McCarthy coined the term “artificial intelligence” in 1956. This period saw the creation of early programs such as Logic Theorist and General Problem Solver.</p>
                    <p>1970s-80s: The rise and fall of AI. Although there were advances, hardware and data limitations led to the so-called “AI winter.”</p>
                    <p>21st century: With the growth of big data, advances in hardware (GPUs), and new algorithms, AI experienced a resurgence. Models such as deep neural networks revolutionized the field.</p>

                    <h3 class="title">Tipos de IA</h3>
                    <p>Weak AI: Designed to perform a specific task, such as virtual assistants or recommendation systems.</p>
                    <p>Strong AI: It would be able to perform any intellectual task like a human. Currently, it is a long-term goal.</p>
                    <p>Artificial superintelligence: An intelligence superior to human intelligence in all aspects. Although it is a theoretical concept, it raises ethical and existential dilemmas.</p>
